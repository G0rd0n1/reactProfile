# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# SovTech Graduates Program | Software Engineer | mini-portfolio page

## My Task

1. I created a static single page application with multiple components, using React and the CRA modern React framework.<br>
    1. It has a home page with an introduction.<br>
    2. A draggable slideshow page which shows a few of my pictures.<br>
    3. A Get to know me page in which I tell you a bit more about myself and why I want to be a developer at SovTech.<br>
    4. A Projects page where I show screenshots and explain 3 of my own personal projects.<br>

## Built using:

- Front-end library: React/
- CSS framework: React-bootstrap/
- CSS animations library: Animate.css/

## The Requirements:
1. It should be deployed using a simple static site hosting service, in which I'm taking advantage of the simplicity of Vercel.<br>
2. Your code should be pushed to a public repository on Github with an updated Readme.<br>
3. The Readme should contain a guide on how to bootstrap the app and a link do the deployed version.<br>
